I recently created a Text-to-Speech application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project enhanced my skills in leveraging the Web Speech API for speech synthesis and dynamic DOM manipulation to create an interactive user experience.

Features 🛠️ :

✅Convert text input to speech with a single click
✅Select from available system voices for speech output
✅Simple and intuitive interface with a textarea and dropdown menu
✅Real-time voice selection for customized speech synthesis  

This project showcases the capabilities of JavaScript and the Web Speech API to build accessible and interactive web applications.
